# Phaser Dungeon Generator

A simple (and very outdated) attempt at creating a dungeon generator using Phaser.js

## How to run

- Install node packages using `npm i`
- Build code by running either...

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  or run the watcher while developing...

  ```
  npm run watch
  ```

- Start by running `npm run start`
